This error occurs when using the Expo Go app to test your application. The error message usually appears as follows:

`Invariant Violation: Text strings must be rendered within a <Text> component.`

This means that you are trying to render a string directly in your JSX without wrapping it within a `<Text>` component from React Native. This is specifically a problem within the context of Expo, which uses React Native under the hood.  The error can manifest in various situations, often related to dynamic content generation or unexpected type conversions.
